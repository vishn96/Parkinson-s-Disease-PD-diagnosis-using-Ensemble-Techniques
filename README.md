# Parkinson-s-Disease-PD-diagnosis-using-Ensemble-Techniques
Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological disorder marked by decreased dopamine levels in the brain. It manifests itself through a deterioration of movement, including the presence of tremors and stiffness. Since PD patients exhibit characteristic vocal features, voice recordings are a useful and non-invasive tool for diagnosis. If machine learning algorithms could be applied to a voice recording dataset to accurately diagnosis PD, this would be an effective screening step prior to an appointment with a clinician.
